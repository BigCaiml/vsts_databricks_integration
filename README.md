### VSTS/Databricks Integration

- Uses the Python VSTS SDK
- Uses the Databricks API

- Requires a VSTS user token
- Requires a Databricks API token

- Supported scenarios:
  1. Push single file to VSTS
  2. Push directory/path(recursive) to VSTS
  3. Pull VSTS directory/path(recursive) to Databricks

- Notes:
	1.	Lbraries are intentionally omitted for now
	2. There are no file compares for deltas
	3. File extensions are appended to the files when adding them to VSTS from Databricks workspace based on export and language
	4. This is prototype/demo codeâ€¦ there is no real error handling built it
	5. Sorry for my non-pythonic style of coding....
